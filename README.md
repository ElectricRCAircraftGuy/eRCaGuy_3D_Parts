If this repo ever gets to the point you'd like to buy a [CC BY 4.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) or other type of license instead, so that you do _not_ have to share and release your modifications under the same CC BY-SA 4.0 copyleft open source license, reach out to me and we can work out a one-time payment or [GitHub sponsorship](https://github.com/sponsors/ElectricRCAircraftGuy) in exchange for a license better suited to meet your need.

Regardless, I hope you find this useful.
